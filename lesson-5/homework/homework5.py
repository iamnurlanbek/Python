"""def is_leap(year):  Determines whether a given year is a leap year.

A year is a leap year if:
- It is divisible by 4, and
- It is NOT divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

Parameters:
year (int): The year to be checked.

Returns:
bool: True if the year is a leap year, False otherwise.
if not isinstance(year, int):
    raise ValueError("Year must be an integer.")

return (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0)"""

2. Conditional Statements Exercise
Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, n.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 100
Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0
3
Sample Output 0
